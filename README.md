# AI-Project-with-Q-Learning

#Introduction
"Agent Arena" is a dynamic 2D simulation built in Unity that demonstrates the principles of reinforcement learning. My team and I implemented the Q-learning algorithm to train two autonomous agents simultaneously within the same environment to learn opposing behaviors: one to chase a target and the other to flee from it.

The project features a flexible reward system and an in-game UI that allows for real-time editing of key training parameters (learning rate, discount factor, etc.), providing immediate visual feedback on how these variables shape the agents' emergent strategies. This project showcases a practical application of reinforcement learning concepts, AI agent design, and interactive simulation development in Unity.

#What is the project about?
This work examines Q-learning as a foundational framework for deep reinforcement learning, with a specific focus on its application in game development. We analyze core principles such as state-action value approximation and policy optimization, illustrating how tabular Q-learning methods scale to more complex, neural-network-based architectures like Deep Q-Networks. By grounding concepts like experience replay in practical gameplay scenarios, the project serves as a working guide for implementing and extending these algorithms to produce emergent, intelligent behaviors in interactive systems.
